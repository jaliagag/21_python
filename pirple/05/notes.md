# Loops

## for loops

```py
for <variable> in <object/variable/string/thing2iterate>:
  action
```

range function: range(start,stop,steps). start and steps are optional - default values are start on 0, step 1 at a time. not including the _stop_ value
 
for num in range(10):
  print(num)

this would give us 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.

## while loops

```py
while (condition):
  action1
  action2
  action3
```
